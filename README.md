The Study on the Velocity Ratio of Binary Black Holes with Galactic Potential.

In my thesis, we primarily study the relationship between velocity ratio and mass ratio in the binary black holes with galactic potential. In the field of astronomy, it is widely accepted that the center of active galactic nuclei hosts supermassive black hole. In the study of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs), [Wang et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/705/1/L76) discovered a significant correlation between the velocity ratio and mass ratio of dual AGNs. Therefore, considering the influence of galactic potential, we explore the relationship between velocity ratio and mass ratio by choosing different initial conditions in binary black holes models.
